\section{Objectives}
Our objectives were four-fold :
{\hyphenation{}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.1cm,topsep=0.1cm]
  \item The \textbf{background} is fully stated.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph* --,align=left,itemsep=.05cm,topsep=0.1cm]
    \item We reviewed the current literature regarding IoT security, especially in the field of light commercial drones.
    \item We found some methodologies and processes for hacking, especially the penetration testing process.
    \item We presented some existing solutions and used a few ones in the exploits and the framework.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The \textbf{scope} was narrowed to only two drones.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph* --,align=left,itemsep=.05cm,topsep=0.1cm]
    \item Multiple provided drones were not suitable for WiFi exploitation and then withdrawn from the scope.
    \item The working of the selected drones was studied.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Some \textbf{exploits} could be written and tested.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph* --,align=left,itemsep=.05cm,topsep=0.1cm]
    \item We found a few attacks chaining multiple hacking techniques.
    \item We wrote a few exploit scripts proven to be effective.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item A new \textbf{framework} is born, tailored to drone hacking.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph* --,align=left,itemsep=.05cm,topsep=0.1cm]
    \item The new framework was made on top of SploitKit and some scanning modules could be included.
    \item The exploit scripts were turned into exploitation modules for DroneSploit.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}}

\section{Matched Criteria}
The level of fulfilment of the evaluation criteria can be assessed as follows :
